**Product Requirements Document (PRD)**

**Product Name:** Samantha LeadGen

**Overview:**
Samantha LeadGen is a full-stack lead management application built using Next.js, Tailwind CSS, Hero UI, TypeScript, and Supabase. The system captures leads through a custom contact form and visualizes their qualification journey through a Kanban-style dashboard. AI-driven voice and email interactions enrich each lead and update their records dynamically.

**Tech Stack:**

* Frontend: Next.js (TypeScript), Tailwind CSS, Hero UI
* Backend: Supabase (Database and Auth)
* Authentication: Supabase Auth with support for both login and signup

**Core Data Model:**

* **Leads Table:**

  * id (UUID, Primary Key)
  * full\_name (text)
  * email (text)
  * phone\_number (text)
  * linkedin (text)
  * remarks (text)
  * extracted\_fields (JSONB, stores dynamic answers based on prompt)
  * status (enum: 'lead', 'qualified', 'disqualified', 'discovery\_call\_scheduled')
  * created\_at (timestamp)

* **Phone Calls Table:**

  * id (UUID, Primary Key)
  * lead\_id (foreign key to Leads)
  * transcript (text)
  * metadata (JSONB – call time, agent name, duration, etc.)
  * created\_at (timestamp)

* **Emails Table:**

  * id (UUID, Primary Key)
  * lead\_id (foreign key to Leads)
  * content (text)
  * metadata (JSONB – subject, timestamp, sender, etc.)
  * created\_at (timestamp)

**Contact Form:**
Fields:

* Full Name
* Email
* Phone Number
* LinkedIn
* Remarks

**Workflow (Outside Scope):**

* Upon form submission, an external Voice AI agent is triggered.
* The agent uses a dynamic prompt (e.g., bootcamp qualification) to ask follow-up questions.
* Call transcript and extracted answers are saved back to Supabase.
* Similar enrichment occurs via email, and the results are synchronized.

**Dynamic Field Extraction:**

* Extracted fields are stored in the `extracted_fields` JSONB column.
* Example fields (based on prompt):

  * has\_10\_hours\_per\_week (boolean)
  * async\_ok (boolean)
  * needs\_financial\_support (boolean)
* Fields and prompts can be modified without changing schema.

**UI Design Requirements:**

* Responsive UI for desktop, tablet, and mobile
* Dashboard view with Kanban board

  * Columns:

    * Leads
    * Qualified
    * Disqualified
    * Discovery Call Scheduled
  * Each card represents a lead
  * Cards are draggable across columns

**Lead Card Detail View:**

* Contact info
* Extracted fields (editable inline)
* Call history (transcripts, call time, metadata)
* Email history (content, metadata)
* Ability to edit or delete any lead, transcript, or email

**Authentication:**

* Supabase Auth for admin login

**Out of Scope (Excluded from This PRD):**

* AI agent implementation
* Google Calendar integration
* Scheduling and time-related features
* Project timelines and sprints

**Non-Functional Requirements:**

* Clean codebase with separation of concerns
* Modular file structure
* Reusable components with well-defined props
* Minimal and intuitive UI design
* Data consistency across phone calls, emails, and leads
