			"taskTitle": "Setup Next.js Project with TypeScript",
			"complexityScore": 4,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the setup process into: initializing the Next.js project with TypeScript, installing and configuring Tailwind CSS, integrating Hero UI, updating dependencies, and configuring tsconfig.json for strict type checking.",
			"reasoning": "Setting up a Next.js project with TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and Hero UI is straightforward due to built-in support and clear documentation. However, integrating multiple tools and ensuring strict type checking adds moderate complexity. Each integration step is distinct and can be a subtask.[1][2][3][4]"
