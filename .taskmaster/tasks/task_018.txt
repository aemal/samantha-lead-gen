# Task ID: 18
# Title: Implement Error Handling and Logging
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: medium
# Description: Develop a comprehensive error handling and logging system.
# Details:
Implement a global error boundary using React Error Boundary. Use a logging service like Sentry (version 7.54.0 or later) for error tracking. Create custom error components for different types of errors (network errors, validation errors, etc.). Implement retry mechanisms for transient errors.

# Test Strategy:
Simulate various error scenarios and verify proper error handling. Check that errors are correctly logged to the chosen logging service. Test retry mechanisms for effectiveness.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Implement Global Error Boundary [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Set up a global error boundary to catch uncaught errors across the application and render a fallback UI.
### Details:
Create or configure a global error boundary component (e.g., ErrorBoundary in React or Blazor) and wrap the main application layout or root component to ensure all errors are caught and handled in a centralized manner.

## 2. Integrate Logging Service [pending]
### Dependencies: 18.1
### Description: Integrate a logging service to record errors captured by the global error boundary for monitoring and debugging.
### Details:
Connect a logging service (such as ILogger, Sentry, or a custom solution) to the error boundary so that all caught exceptions are logged with relevant context and stack traces.

## 3. Create Custom Error Components [pending]
### Dependencies: 18.1
### Description: Design and implement custom error components to display user-friendly error messages and branding.
### Details:
Develop custom error UI components that can be rendered by the error boundary, providing clear feedback to users and aligning with the application's design language.

## 4. Add Retry Mechanisms [pending]
### Dependencies: 18.3
### Description: Implement retry mechanisms in error components to allow users to attempt failed actions again.
### Details:
Enhance custom error components with retry logic, such as buttons or automatic retries, to improve user experience and resilience against transient errors.

## 5. Test Error Scenarios [pending]
### Dependencies: 18.2, 18.3, 18.4
### Description: Test various error scenarios to ensure the error boundary, logging, custom components, and retry mechanisms work as intended.
### Details:
Simulate different types of errors (e.g., network failures, unhandled exceptions) and verify that errors are caught, logged, displayed with custom components, and that retry mechanisms function correctly.
