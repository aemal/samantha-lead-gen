# Task ID: 17
# Title: Implement Search and Filtering
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 9
# Priority: low
# Description: Add search and filtering capabilities for leads across all columns.
# Details:
Implement a search input for filtering leads by name, email, or phone number. Use Supabase full-text search capabilities for efficient searching. Implement filtering by lead status and other relevant fields. Consider using debounce for search input to reduce unnecessary API calls.

# Test Strategy:
Test search functionality with various query terms. Verify that filtering works correctly for different field combinations. Test search performance with large datasets.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Implement Search Input UI [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Design and develop a user interface component that allows users to input search queries. Ensure the UI is intuitive and integrates seamlessly with the existing application layout.
### Details:
This includes creating a text input field, a search button, and any necessary UI feedback (e.g., loading indicators).

## 2. Integrate Supabase Full-Text Search [pending]
### Dependencies: 17.1
### Description: Connect the search input to Supabase's full-text search functionality. Ensure that queries from the UI are sent to Supabase and results are displayed to the user.
### Details:
Use Supabase's textSearch function or relevant API to perform efficient full-text searches on the desired database columns.

## 3. Add Filtering by Status/Fields [pending]
### Dependencies: 17.2
### Description: Enhance the search functionality by allowing users to filter results based on status or other relevant fields.
### Details:
Implement dropdowns, checkboxes, or other UI elements for filtering. Update the backend query logic to include these filters in the Supabase search requests.

## 4. Optimize Search Performance with Debounce [pending]
### Dependencies: 17.3
### Description: Improve search performance and user experience by implementing a debounce mechanism, reducing unnecessary backend calls during rapid input.
### Details:
Add debounce logic to the search input so that Supabase queries are only triggered after the user has stopped typing for a short period.
