# Task ID: 9
# Title: Develop Lead Fetching and State Management
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 2, 7, 8
# Priority: high
# Description: Implement logic to fetch leads from Supabase and manage lead state in the frontend.
# Details:
Use SWR (v2.2.0 or later) or React Query (v3.39.3 or later) for data fetching and caching. Implement pagination or infinite scrolling for efficient data loading. Use TypeScript for type-safe state management. Consider using Zustand (v4.3.8 or later) for global state management if needed.

# Test Strategy:
Test data fetching with various query parameters. Verify that state updates correctly when leads are modified. Test pagination or infinite scrolling functionality.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Integrate Data Fetching Library [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Select and set up a data fetching library (such as SWR or React Query) in the project to enable efficient and type-safe data retrieval.
### Details:
Install the chosen library, configure it for use with TypeScript, and ensure it is ready for use in components.

## 2. Implement Lead Fetching Logic [pending]
### Dependencies: 9.1
### Description: Develop the logic to fetch lead data from the backend API using the integrated data fetching library.
### Details:
Create a function or hook that retrieves leads, handles loading and error states, and ensures type safety with TypeScript.

## 3. Add Pagination or Infinite Scroll [pending]
### Dependencies: 9.2
### Description: Implement pagination or infinite scroll to efficiently handle large datasets and improve user experience.
### Details:
Modify the lead fetching logic to support fetching additional pages or batches of data as the user navigates or scrolls.

## 4. Manage State with TypeScript [pending]
### Dependencies: 9.3
### Description: Set up state management for leads and related UI states using TypeScript to ensure type safety and maintainability.
### Details:
Define appropriate types and interfaces, and use state management patterns (such as useState, useReducer, or context) as needed.

## 5. Handle State Updates [pending]
### Dependencies: 9.4
### Description: Implement robust logic to update state in response to data fetching, pagination, and user actions, ensuring consistency and performance.
### Details:
Ensure that state updates are efficient, avoid unnecessary re-renders, and handle edge cases such as errors or empty results.
