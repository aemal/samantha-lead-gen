# Task ID: 3
# Title: Implement Supabase Authentication
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1, 2
# Priority: high
# Description: Set up Supabase Authentication for admin login functionality.
# Details:
Use Supabase Auth UI (v0.2.2 or later) for quick implementation. Configure auth providers (email/password at minimum). Implement protected routes using Next.js middleware. Use Supabase's setSession method for client-side auth state management.

# Test Strategy:
Test user registration, login, and logout flows. Verify that protected routes are inaccessible without authentication.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Integrate Supabase Auth UI [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Set up and integrate the Supabase Auth UI component into the Next.js application to provide a user interface for authentication.
### Details:
Install the @supabase/auth-ui-react package and add the Auth UI component to the relevant page or component in your Next.js app. Ensure the Supabase client is initialized and environment variables are configured.

## 2. Configure Email/Password Provider [pending]
### Dependencies: 3.1
### Description: Enable and configure the email/password authentication provider in the Supabase project and ensure the frontend supports sign-up and sign-in with email/password.
### Details:
In the Supabase dashboard, enable the email/password provider. Update the Auth UI component or custom forms to handle email/password sign-up and sign-in flows.

## 3. Implement Protected Routes with Next.js Middleware [pending]
### Dependencies: 3.2
### Description: Set up Next.js middleware to protect specific routes, ensuring only authenticated users can access them.
### Details:
Create middleware in the Next.js app that checks for a valid Supabase session before allowing access to protected routes. Redirect unauthenticated users to the login page.

## 4. Manage Client-Side Auth State [pending]
### Dependencies: 3.3
### Description: Implement logic to manage and react to authentication state changes on the client side.
### Details:
Use Supabase's client libraries to listen for auth state changes and update the UI accordingly. Ensure user session information is accessible throughout the app.

## 5. Test Authentication Flows [pending]
### Dependencies: 3.4
### Description: Thoroughly test all authentication flows, including sign-up, sign-in, sign-out, and access to protected routes.
### Details:
Perform manual and/or automated tests to verify that authentication works as expected, protected routes are enforced, and auth state is managed correctly.
