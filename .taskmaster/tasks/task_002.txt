# Description: Create a new Supabase project and implement the required database schema for leads, phone calls, and emails.
# Details:
Create a new Supabase project. Use Supabase CLI (version 1.64.8 or later) to manage database migrations. Implement the schema for Leads, Phone Calls, and Emails tables as specified in the PRD. Use appropriate data types and constraints. Enable Row Level Security (RLS) for all tables.
