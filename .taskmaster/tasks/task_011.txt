# Task ID: 11
# Title: Develop Inline Editing for Lead Details
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 10
# Priority: medium
# Description: Implement functionality to edit lead details and extracted fields inline.
# Details:
Use React Hook Form for managing edit state. Implement optimistic updates for better UX. Ensure proper validation for all editable fields. Use Supabase real-time subscriptions to keep data in sync across clients.

# Test Strategy:
Test editing various lead fields. Verify that changes are immediately reflected in the UI and persisted to the database. Test concurrent edits from multiple clients.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Integrate React Hook Form for Editing [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Set up React Hook Form in the component to manage form state for editing records, including initializing default values and connecting form controls.
### Details:
Use useForm and Controller from React Hook Form to manage form state and validation for editable fields. Ensure the form is initialized with the current record's data.

## 2. Implement Inline Edit UI [pending]
### Dependencies: 11.1
### Description: Create an inline editable UI that allows users to edit fields directly within the list or table view.
### Details:
Use a component pattern where fields toggle between display and input modes based on an isEditing state. Integrate form controls from React Hook Form into the inline UI.

## 3. Add Field Validation [pending]
### Dependencies: 11.1, 11.2
### Description: Define and enforce validation rules for editable fields using React Hook Form's validation capabilities.
### Details:
Specify validation rules (e.g., required, pattern, min/max length) in the Controller or useForm configuration. Display validation errors inline in the UI.

## 4. Implement Optimistic Updates [pending]
### Dependencies: 11.2, 11.3
### Description: Update the UI immediately when a user edits a field, before the server confirms the change, to provide a responsive experience.
### Details:
On form submission, update the local state optimistically and trigger the API call. Roll back changes if the server update fails.

## 5. Sync Data with Supabase Real-Time [pending]
### Dependencies: 11.4
### Description: Ensure that edits are synchronized with Supabase in real-time, updating the UI when changes occur from other clients.
### Details:
Integrate Supabase real-time subscriptions to listen for changes and update the local state accordingly. Handle potential conflicts between optimistic updates and incoming real-time data.
