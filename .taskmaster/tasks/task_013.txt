# Task ID: 13
# Title: Create Phone Call History Component
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 10
# Priority: medium
# Description: Develop a component to display phone call history for each lead.
# Details:
Design a list or table to display call transcripts and metadata. Implement pagination or virtual scrolling for efficient rendering of large call histories. Use Hero UI components for consistent styling.

# Test Strategy:
Test rendering of call history with various amounts of data. Verify that all metadata is correctly displayed. Test pagination or virtual scrolling functionality.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Design Call History UI [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create the visual layout for the call history screen, including headers, list items, and group headers. Ensure the design is consistent with the application's style guide and supports integration with Hero UI components.
### Details:
Use React component design patterns to structure the UI. Consider using templates for customizing list items and headers as demonstrated with Syncfusion React ListView. Plan for extensibility and maintainability.

## 2. Implement Data Fetching Logic [pending]
### Dependencies: 13.1
### Description: Develop the logic to fetch call history data from the backend or API, handling loading and error states appropriately.
### Details:
Utilize React hooks (such as useEffect and useState) or custom hooks for managing asynchronous data fetching. Ensure the data model aligns with the UI requirements and supports pagination or virtual scroll.

## 3. Add Pagination or Virtual Scroll [pending]
### Dependencies: 13.2
### Description: Integrate efficient list rendering by implementing pagination or virtual scrolling to handle large call history datasets.
### Details:
Choose between pagination and virtual scroll based on expected data volume and user experience goals. Ensure smooth scrolling and minimal performance impact. Update data fetching logic to support incremental data loading.

## 4. Integrate Hero UI Components [pending]
### Dependencies: 13.1, 13.2, 13.3
### Description: Replace or enhance default UI elements with Hero UI components to ensure consistent styling and improved user experience.
### Details:
Identify which parts of the call history UI can leverage Hero UI components (e.g., list items, buttons, headers). Refactor the UI to use these components, ensuring accessibility and responsiveness.
