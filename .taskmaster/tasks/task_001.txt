# Title: Setup Next.js Project with TypeScript
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Initialize a new Next.js project with TypeScript support, Tailwind CSS, and Hero UI.
# Details:
Use create-next-app to set up a new Next.js project with TypeScript. Install and configure Tailwind CSS and Hero UI. Ensure all dependencies are up-to-date. Use Next.js 13 or later for improved performance and features. Configure tsconfig.json for strict type checking.

# Test Strategy:
Verify that the project builds without errors. Run a sample page to ensure TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and Hero UI are working correctly.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Initialize Next.js Project with TypeScript [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create a new Next.js project using the create-next-app CLI with TypeScript support.
### Details:
Run `npx create-next-app@latest my-project --typescript` to bootstrap a new Next.js project preconfigured for TypeScript. This will generate the necessary file structure and a tsconfig.json file.

## 2. Install and Configure Tailwind CSS [pending]
### Dependencies: 1.1
### Description: Add Tailwind CSS to the Next.js project and configure it for use.

Install the Hero UI package (such as @heroicons/react or a similar library) and import components as needed in your Next.js pages or components.

## 4. Update Project Dependencies [pending]
### Dependencies: 1.3
### Description: Ensure all project dependencies are up to date and compatible.
### Details:
Run `npm update` or `yarn upgrade` to update dependencies. Check for any compatibility issues between Next.js, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and Hero UI.

## 5. Configure tsconfig.json for Strict Type Checking [pending]
### Dependencies: 1.4
### Description: Adjust the tsconfig.json file to enable strict type checking and recommended TypeScript options.
### Details:
Edit tsconfig.json to set `"strict": true` and enable other strict options such as `noImplicitAny`, `strictNullChecks`, and `strictFunctionTypes` for improved type safety.
