# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 7, 8, 9
# Priority: high
# Description: Add drag-and-drop functionality to move lead cards between Kanban board columns.
# Details:
Use react-beautiful-dnd for drag-and-drop implementation. Update lead status in Supabase when a card is moved. Implement optimistic updates for smooth UX. Ensure drag-and-drop works on touch devices.

# Test Strategy:
Test dragging cards between all column combinations. Verify that lead status updates correctly in the database. Test drag-and-drop on various devices, including touch screens.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Integrate react-beautiful-dnd into the Project [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Install and configure the react-beautiful-dnd library in the React application. Set up DragDropContext, Droppable, and Draggable components to enable basic drag-and-drop functionality.
### Details:
Ensure the library is installed via npm or yarn. Wrap the relevant component tree with DragDropContext and implement at least one Droppable area containing Draggable items.

## 2. Update Lead Status on Drop [pending]
### Dependencies: 16.1
### Description: Implement logic to update the lead status when a drag-and-drop operation completes, using the onDragEnd handler.
### Details:
In the onDragEnd callback, detect the source and destination of the drop and update the lead's status in the application state accordingly.

## 3. Implement Optimistic UI Updates [pending]
### Dependencies: 16.2
### Description: Ensure that UI updates immediately reflect changes when a lead is moved, before waiting for server confirmation.
### Details:
Update the local state optimistically in the onDragEnd handler and handle potential rollback if the server update fails.

## 4. Ensure Touch Device Support [pending]
### Dependencies: 16.3
### Description: Test and enhance drag-and-drop interactions to work smoothly on touch devices such as tablets and smartphones.
### Details:
Verify that react-beautiful-dnd's touch support is functioning as expected and make any necessary adjustments for mobile usability.

## 5. Test All Drag-and-Drop Interactions [pending]
### Dependencies: 16.4
### Description: Thoroughly test drag-and-drop functionality across devices and scenarios, including edge cases and error handling.
### Details:
Write and execute manual and automated tests to ensure all interactions work as intended, including optimistic updates and touch support.
