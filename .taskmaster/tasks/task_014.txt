# Task ID: 14
# Title: Implement Email History Component
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 10
# Priority: medium
# Description: Create a component to display email history for each lead.
# Details:
Design a list or table to display email content and metadata. Implement pagination or virtual scrolling for efficient rendering of large email histories. Use Hero UI components for consistent styling. Consider implementing a simple email viewer for full email content.

# Test Strategy:
Test rendering of email history with various amounts of data. Verify that all metadata is correctly displayed. Test pagination or virtual scrolling functionality.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Design Email History UI [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create wireframes and mockups for the email history interface, focusing on usability and familiar UI patterns (e.g., list view, search, filters, and clear navigation). Ensure the design accommodates future integration of an email viewer and supports responsive layouts.
### Details:
Incorporate proven UI/UX patterns such as grid-based or single-column layouts, clear primary actions, and progressive disclosure to minimize cognitive load. Reference best practices from leading email clients for consistency and user familiarity.

## 2. Implement Data Fetching Logic [pending]
### Dependencies: 14.1
### Description: Develop the backend and frontend logic to fetch email history data from the server or data source, ensuring efficient loading and error handling.
### Details:
Use asynchronous data fetching with loading indicators (e.g., skeleton loaders) to improve perceived performance. Ensure the API supports filtering, sorting, and searching as designed in the UI.

## 3. Add Pagination or Virtual Scroll [pending]
### Dependencies: 14.2
### Description: Integrate pagination or virtual scrolling to efficiently handle large volumes of email history data in the UI.
### Details:
Choose between traditional pagination or virtual scroll based on expected data size and user experience goals. Implement UI controls for navigation and ensure smooth, performant scrolling or page transitions.

## 4. Integrate Email Viewer Component [pending]
### Dependencies: 14.3
### Description: Embed a full-featured email viewer within the email history UI, allowing users to read, reply, and interact with individual emails.
### Details:
Ensure the viewer supports rich HTML email rendering, responsive design, and accessibility. Consider progressive disclosure to keep the main history view uncluttered, revealing the viewer only when an email is selected.
