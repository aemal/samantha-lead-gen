# Task ID: 6
# Title: Develop Lead Submission Logic
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 2, 5
# Priority: high
# Description: Implement the logic to submit lead data to Supabase upon form submission.
# Details:
Use Supabase JavaScript client (v2.26.0 or later) to insert new lead data. Implement error handling and success feedback. Use TypeScript to ensure type safety for lead data. Consider using optimistic updates for better UX.

# Test Strategy:
Test lead submission with various data sets. Verify that data is correctly inserted into Supabase. Test error scenarios and ensure proper error handling.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Integrate Supabase Client [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Set up and configure the Supabase client in the project to enable communication with the Supabase backend.
### Details:
Create utility files (e.g., client.js) to initialize the Supabase client using environment variables for the Supabase URL and anon key. Ensure the client is accessible where needed in the application.

## 2. Implement Lead Data Submission [pending]
### Dependencies: 6.1
### Description: Develop the functionality to submit lead data from the frontend to the Supabase database.
### Details:
Create a form or interface for users to enter lead data and use the Supabase client to insert this data into the appropriate table in the database.

## 3. Add Error Handling and Feedback [pending]
### Dependencies: 6.2
### Description: Incorporate robust error handling and user feedback mechanisms for the lead submission process.
### Details:
Detect and handle errors during data submission, displaying clear feedback messages to users for both success and failure scenarios.

## 4. Support Optimistic Updates [pending]
### Dependencies: 6.3
### Description: Implement optimistic UI updates to immediately reflect lead submissions in the interface before confirmation from the backend.
### Details:
Update the UI state as soon as a lead is submitted, rolling back changes if an error occurs during the actual database operation.
